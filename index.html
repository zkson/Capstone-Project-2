        <p class="para about-me">From a young age, I’ve been passionate about the software field. It has always been my dream. My academic journey reflects this dedication, with strong performances in school, achieving 89% in 10th standard and 83% in 12th standard.<br /> <br />
            Despite facing financial challenges that led me to pursue a Diploma in Mechanical engineering, my ambition to enter the software industry never wanted. Recently, I have broadened by earning a Bachelor’s Degree in Computer Applications. Currently, I am actively preparing to make this transition by studying Full Stack Web Development, Java, and Python programming.<br /> <br />
            I’m excited about the future and eager to bring my skills and enthusiasm to the world of software development.
